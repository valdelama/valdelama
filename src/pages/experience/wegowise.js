      <p>
        For five years I was responsible for product and marketing design at
        WegoWise, the largest database of multifamily utilty data in the US.
        During that time I established and promoted a design-first company
        culture that emphasised validating early-stage designs through user
        testing.

            The dashboard at WegoWise had become a dumping ground for links to
            miscellaneous pages as the site continued to grow and the result was
            an unwieldy, long navigation menu with lots of unrelated links
            sitting side-by-side.

            The challenge was to design a dashboard that would be the initial
            screen that all WegoWise users would see after logging in.
          </p>
          <p>
            We needed to create something that would be useful to all customer
            types, that is configurable, and that is able to clearly display a
            high density of information. The information on display had to be
            both high-level summary data and also detailed data, specific to
            individual properties.

              I led the design and front-end development of a web application
              that would enable financial institutions to assess the eligibility
              of real estate properties for green loans.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was an interesting project to work on as we were pioneering a
              new product in a very young, growing sector of the financial
              technology world. I learned a lot from my collaboration with
              business development and calls with customers from some of the
              largest financial institutions in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
              The product was very well received and continues to be a success.
